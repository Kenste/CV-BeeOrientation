The second architecture integrates a ResNet18 encoder into a U-Net-like decoder structure, following Mukasheva et al.'s~\cite{mukasheva2024modification} idea of using a ResNet backbone with skip connections to improve segmentation quality.
For the implementation, we followed the decoder design from the segmentation\_models.pytorch repository~\cite{Iakubovskii:2019}.

The encoder is a pretrained ResNet18, and its intermediate feature maps are connected with upsampled decoder outputs via skip connections.
The decoder mirrors the U-Net structure and ends with a 1Ã—1 convolution, producing three-class logits.

As with the U-Net3, we used the Adam optimizer with the same learning rate and loss weights and trained the model for ten epochs.
Due to the larger encoder, the ResUNet18 has substantially more parameters (\qty{14239721}{}) than the U-Net3.
